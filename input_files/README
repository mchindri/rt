	LIGHT: x y z
	SPHERE: x y z r color //x,y,z=center coordinates. r=radious
	CONE: x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 r d color //point 1=center of the cone. Point 2 = 
		  any point of the central axis. r = radious of the point 2. d=distance
		  between points.
	CYLINDER: x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 r color //2 points of the central axis r=radious

Example:

>user$ cat first_test.txt 
10 10 10
0 0 0 9 red
1 1 1 1 1 2 6 blue
>user$ 

This file contains one red circle with the center in (0,0,0) and with the 
radious 9. And one blue cylindre with the central axis crossing the points
(1,1,1) and (1,1,2) with the radious 6. The ligth is in te position (10, 10, 10)
